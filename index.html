            <h1>Congratulations!</h1>
            <p>At the last order of the king of a destroyed kingdom, you were able to defeat all (for now) the defenders of this tower that was spreading chaos across the region.</p>
            <p>However, when contemplating the horizon from the top floor of the Red Tower, an overwhelming sight. It seems that this was not the only tower mysteriously erected. Dozens more are scattered as far as the eye can see.</p>
            <p>Is it a feat of the Arcanists, who left this planet taking all their intelligence and magic to live on our nearest moon because they thought we were "primitive"?</p>
            <p>Maybe the moon isn't big enough for them and their ego.</p>
            <p>Or worst? There are several stories of a world beyond ours that from time to time resurfaces to put us to the test.</p>
            <p>Theories are many but there is only one way to know.</p>
            <p>The mission must go on!</p>
            <p>(coming soon)</p>
